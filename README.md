# ValoSpectra - Frontend

Spectra is your all-in-one solution for an amazing looking Valorant Tournament Overlay, enabling all Organizers to display information like held gun, available credits etc. with just a single spectator running software.
To learn more and see a live demo, visit [valospectra.com](https://www.valospectra.com/).

It is comprised of three parts:

- [The Spectra Client](https://github.com/ValoSpectra/Spectra-Client)
  - Running this software on a single in-game observer provides the Spectra Server with all data currently provided by Overwolf.
- [The Spectra Server](https://github.com/ValoSpectra/Spectra-Server)
  - Ingests data from the Observer Client to reproduce the games state, allowing us to have an accurate representation of the game for further use.
- [The Spectra Frontend](https://github.com/ValoSpectra/Spectra-Frontend)
  - Receives the game state from the Server every 100 milliseconds, presenting it in a beautiful manner for viewers to enjoy.

Further updates for new features, as well as a detailed setup guide and an easy to host docker container are in the pipeline!

# Docker Compose tutorial:

First, create a seperate folder in your working directory and create a folder ` config` inside it:

```
mkdir -p spectra-frontend/config
cd spectra-frontend
```

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` as follow:

```
---
services:
  valo-spectra-frontend:
    image: "ghcr.io/valospectra/overlay"
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/usr/share/nginx/html/assets/config/
```

You can change `3000` to a different port which you want the frontend accessible outside the container to.

Inside `config` folder, create a file named `config.json` with the following content:

```
{
  "serverEndpoint": "http://localhost:5200",
  "sponsorImageUrls": ["/assets/misc/logo.webp"],
  "sponsorImageRotateSpeed": 5000,
  "attackerColorPrimary": "#b82e3c",
  "attackerColorSecondary": "#ff4557",
  "attackerColorShieldCurrency": "#ff838f",
  "defenderColorPrimary": "#25ac79",
  "defenderColorSecondary": "#61eab6",
  "defenderColorShieldCurrency": "#61eab6"
}
```

For the most up to date version of the available configuration values, check out the `config.ts` file in the `src/app/shared/config.ts` file.

Replace `https://localhost:5200` with your Spectra Server address and outcoming port (default is 5200).

After that you can start the frontend by running `docker compose up -d` and the frontend are accessible at port `3000` by default.
